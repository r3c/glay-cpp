Glay: Groundwork Layer (C++)
============================

Overview
--------

My small utility library for C++.

Installation
------------

Currently works only on Windows (mostly because of the "parallel" module).

Grab a C++ compiler compatible with basic C++11 features such as GCC, update
the Makefile.conf if needed and run make.

Licence
